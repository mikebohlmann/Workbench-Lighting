# Workbench-Lighting
Workbench lighting system powered by Arduino, Neopixels, rotary encoder

Using a Neopixel strip, Arduino (or Arduino clone), and a rotary encoder, 
this sketch makes any lighting system into a fun LED lighting system.

It has four modes:
Off - duh
On - all white LEDs are on, rotary encoder changes brightness
Spotlight - subset of LEDs are on, rotary encoder changes position
Dance Party - random colors and effects, rotary encoer changes beats per minute
